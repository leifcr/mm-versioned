mm-versioned
============
A MongoMapper plugin which enables document versioning.
Even though there are mm-revisionable, mm-versionable and mongomapper-versioned, I needed different features.
This has some ideas from all of mentioned, but with a different view.

Documentation will come later when it's more stable.
