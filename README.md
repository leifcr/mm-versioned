mm-versioned
============
A MongoMapper plugin which enables document versioning.
I wrote this because even though there are mm-revisionable, mm-versionable and mongomapper-versioned. 
This has some ideas from all of them, but implements some functionality in a different way.

Documentation will come later when it's ready...
